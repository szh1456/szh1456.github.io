* I am Zihang Song, currently a third-year Ph.D. student at [School of Computer
Science and Electronic Engineering](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-electrical-electronic-engineering), [University of
Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/). I am a member of [the Institute for Communications Systems (ICS), home of the 5G/6G Innovation Centre (5G/6GIC)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/institute-communication-systems), under the supervision of [Professor Yue Gao](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/yue-gao) and [Professor Rahim Tafazolli](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/rahim-tafazolli-freng). I am a research assistant of the EPSRC project  [GHz bandwidth sensing (GBSense)](http://www.gbsense.net/).

* My research interest lies in the intersection of **learning-driven cognitive communication** and **compressed signal processing**. I am especially interested in solving the sparse inverse problems from compressive samples of wideband radio signal and practical sensing matrices design by optimization and learning methods.

* I am passionate about **hardward design of state-of-the-art communication systems**. I have developed **the first known prototype of the uniform periodic sampling architecture** [link](http://www.gbsense.net/nd.jsp?id=18&fromMid=393&fromColId=105), which achieves sparse spectrum sensing over 2GHz bandwidth by sampling at an average rate of 400MHz. I am also interested in development of software-defined transceiver platforms.

* I received my bachelor's and master's degree from School of Physics at Beihang University.

* [08/2022] Our paper [**"Approaching Sub-Nyquist Boundary: Optimized Compressed Spectrum Sensing Based on Multicoset Sampler for Multiband Signal"**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9855237) has been accepted to **IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing**. The paper discusses upon a practical basis the gap of average sampling rates between theorital bound and compressed spectrum sensing practice. An coordinated optimization framework is proposed to significantly improve the spectral support recovery performace.

* [06/2022] Our team at University of Surrey is running a [**"Deep Sub-Nyquist Modulation Recognition Challenge‚Äù (GBSense Challenge 2022)**](www.gbsense.net) with a first prize winner who could get USD 10,000! The challenge is sponsored by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), China Institute of Communications (CIC), and Fudan University. Stay tuned!

* [04/2022] The [**GBSense Challenge 2021**](http://www.gbsense.net/challenge2021/) Award Ceremony hosted by our team at University of Surrey was successfully held online! At the ceremony, IET and IEEE Fellow Prof. Mark Plumbley gave a talk on the general benefits of data challenges and reproducible research to a research community. He also announced together with Prof. Yue Gao the four winner teams of GBSense Challenge 2021 and their outstanding works on accurate Sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing. Congrats!

* [03/2022] We proudly launch [**GBSense Board 1.0**](http://www.gbsense.net/nd.jsp?id=18&fromMid=393&fromColId=105), the first system ever achieves wideband spectrum sensing at a sub-Nyquist rate that implements nonuniform periodic sapling architeture. GBSense Board 1.0 employs eight parallel ADCs with 50MSPS rate to sample analog signal within 2GHz bandwidth. The sampling sequence is processed in real time by a high-performace FPGA device and deliverd to host CPU, where the embedded compressed sensing algorithms reconstruct the wideband spectrum and display it via a well-designed user interface.
